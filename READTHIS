pedromorgan,

I've moved my development tree to Github (http://github.com/nick125/ArduinoIDE-PyQt), 
as SVN decided that it didn't like me and I didn't like it. So, my latest changes are 
there. I migrated the repo, so all of the history in SVN is there. Your account should 
have commit access to that repo, so feel free. We can still use Google Code for issue 
tracking and wiki, or I can move my commits to SVN. I'd prefer to stay on Github,
though. 

I've done a bit of moving around. Stuff that's related to the dock is in gui/dockwidgets,
stuff that's a pane is in gui/panes, and so on. 

I also added some things to the browser so we can call Python functions from Javascript in 
the browser. That code is in gui.Browser.BrowserActions. This should allow us to make a 
really fancy welcome.html. I want to revamp the gui.Browser.BrowserWidget code to use normal
file:// rather than piping the HTML in. If we need to, we can add an functions as 
Javascript later for scripting within the browser. It's a better idea than doing
replaces. 

gui.QuickStart is where I want to put the new QuickStart wizard, with the Arduino tools 
downloader, etc. 

I did a large number of code cleanups. When I started, we had a -9.8/10 in PyLint, and 
now we have a 7.2/10, which means that the code quality has improved significantly. 
I'm planning on going through the code more in-depth and documenting it with docstrings. 
So much fun.

I hope you aren't too upset by any of the changes. Tomorrow, I'm hoping to start some 
real development after I get the rest of the code base documented and cleaned up.

Cheers,
Nick
